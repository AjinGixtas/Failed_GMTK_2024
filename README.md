# GMTK 2024 Game Jam - Failed

## Project Overview

This repository contains the unfinished project I attempted for the GMTK 2024 Game Jam. Although the game is far from complete, I’m sharing the code as a way to document and reflect on my experience during the jam. The purpose of this README is to explain what went wrong and to allow others to explore the project if they find any aspect of it interesting or useful.

## The Idea

The theme for the jam was "Build to Scale," and my concept revolved around the idea of a tower producing resources and "showering" them on other towers. While the idea wasn't overly ambitious, I clearly overestimated my ability to execute this vision within the 96-hour timeframe.

## What Went Wrong

### Overestimating My Abilities

I approached this project with a clear concept and a solid plan, but I overestimated my ability to implement the complex systems I envisioned. While I have some experience in game development, this project required advanced skills in areas where I am less experienced, such as:

- **UI/UX Design**: I struggled to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. The complexity of the UI elements I planned far exceeded my current design skills, resulting in a clunky and incomplete interface.
  
- **Game Architecture**: The game's core mechanics relied heavily on complex system-wide and architectural elements. My lack of experience in this area meant I couldn’t implement these features effectively, leading to gameplay that was either too simplistic or entirely broken.
  
- **Polish and Finishing Touches**: While the basic framework of the game was in place, I lacked the time and expertise to polish it. This includes smooth animations, responsive controls, sound effects, and other details that make a game feel complete.

### Time Management

Although I didn’t overscope, I underestimated the time and effort required to bring the game to a polished state. I spent too much time on certain aspects of the project, leaving me scrambling to complete others as the deadline approached.

### Experience Level

Simply put, my experience level wasn’t sufficient to pull off the vision I had for this game. The gap between my skills and the project’s requirements became increasingly evident as the weekend progressed.

## Why Share This Project?

I decided to make this repository public as a "Medal of Failure." This project serves as a reminder of my current abilities and will help track my progress over time. By sharing this, I hope to:

- **Encourage Experimentation**: If you’re interested in exploring the code, feel free to fork the repository, play around with the mechanics, or even build on top of it (though I highly discourage this if you expect proper documentation or clean code).

- **Document Mistakes**: Failure is an unavoidable part of any journey. Despite failing many times, I’ve still not learned as much as I’d hoped. Hopefully, making these scrapped and failed projects public will help you and others avoid the same mistakes.

- **Document the Journey**: This project will remain in my profile history as a "medal of failure"—or a "mark of shame," if you’re as strict as I am.

## What's Next?

Moving forward, I plan to focus on improving my skills in UI/UX design, software architecture, and game polish. I will apply the lessons learned from this experience to future projects, with the goal of better estimating my capabilities and managing my time more effectively.

## Final Thoughts

Thank you for taking the time to check out this project. Whether you’re here to learn, tinker, or simply see what went wrong, I hope you find something valuable in this repository. Failure is an inevitable part of any endeavor, and I’ve fallen into the obvious traps I was trying to avoid from the start.

Thoughts, suggestions, and contributions are welcome.
